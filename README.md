# Steps involved in making the model 
1) Importing our data. <br>
2) Checking for null values and finding mean of different columns, their min and max values, and getting information about different columns of our data.<br>
3) Visualizing our data in order to find out the best columns to use as features for our model. <br>
4) Make a copy of original data to make the changes and seperate out the columns that we will use as our features. <br>
5) Feeding these features to three different Models i.e. Logistic Regression, KNN and SVM to get the best results.<br>
6) Concluding our analysis by testing the model with some random user input.<br>

# Result  
The Model were able to make a decent prediction about whether a person will be placed or not. Out of the three, Logistic Regression gave us the best results. These models cann still be improved to make more accurate predictions. <br>
